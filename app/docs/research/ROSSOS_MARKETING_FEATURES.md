## Hero Features (Top 5 Differentiators)

### 1. Cost Intelligence Engine
> "Know what things cost—instantly, accurately, always."

- Real-time material pricing database that learns from every invoice and bid
- Track prices at SKU level (TruStile TS3000 3068) not just category level
- Price trend alerts: "Lumber up 15% this quarter—lock in pricing now"
- Lead time intelligence: "Windows averaging 18 weeks—order by [date]"
- Vendor quote comparison with historical context

**Marketing Copy**: "Stop digging through old invoices. RossOS remembers every price, every vendor, every lead time—and gets smarter with every job you build."

### 2. AI-Powered Estimating
> "Estimates that learn from your history, not generic databases."

- Auto-fill estimates from YOUR historical costs, not industry averages
- Completeness checking: "You're missing [common item] for this project type"
- Bias detection: "Your electrical estimates are typically 8% low"
- Plan parsing: Upload PDFs, get preliminary scope and quantities
- Assembly auto-updates: Change one component price, all assemblies recalculate

**Marketing Copy**: "Your estimates should get more accurate over time, not less. RossOS learns from every completed job to make your next bid better."

### 3. Vendor Intelligence Profiles
> "Know your vendors better than they know themselves."

- Automatic scorecards: Reliability, quality, communication, price, schedule impact
- Bid vs. actual tracking: "This vendor's bids are typically 5% optimistic"
- Change order frequency by vendor
- Crew-level tracking: "John's crew averages $4.10/SF vs. company average of $4.35"
- Capacity awareness: "Vendor X has 8 active jobs—may be stretched"

**Marketing Copy**: "Good vendors make good projects. RossOS tracks every interaction to show you who delivers—and who doesn't."

### 4. Schedule Intelligence
> "Schedules that predict delays before they happen."

- Learn actual durations from daily logs automatically
- Vendor reliability factored into scheduling
- Weather integration with automatic task flagging
- Tide charts for coastal waterfront work
- Completion predictions with confidence intervals

**Marketing Copy**: "Stop guessing when the project will finish. RossOS learns from every delay to predict—and prevent—the next one."

### 5. Document Intelligence
> "Every document parsed, understood, and remembered."

- Invoice OCR with automatic budget matching
- Bid extraction with line-item comparison
- Contract analysis flagging unusual terms
- Plan room with version control and markup
- Cross-project search: "Find every quote for TruStile doors"

**Marketing Copy**: "Drop in a PDF. RossOS reads it, extracts the data, matches it to your budget, and stores it for future intelligence—automatically."

> "The system told me to order windows three weeks earlier than I would have. Saved the project from a month-long delay."
