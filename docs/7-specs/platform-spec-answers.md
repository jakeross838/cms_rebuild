# Platform Specification — Business Requirements

> Status: PLACEHOLDER — This document should contain the original business requirements questionnaire and answers that drove the platform design.

## Source
This document corresponds to the `platform-spec-answers.md` referenced in the Claude Code Blueprint (§1.1 Step 1).

## Current State
The business requirements are currently distributed across:
- `docs/specs/platform-vision.md` — Strategic vision and pain points
- `docs/research/marketing-features.md` — Feature positioning
- `docs/research/competitor-analysis.md` — Competitive gaps

## TODO
- [ ] Consolidate all business requirements into this single document
- [ ] Organize by category (SaaS Architecture, Financial, Field Operations, etc.)
- [ ] Include original questionnaire questions and answers
- [ ] Cross-reference to gap analysis items
