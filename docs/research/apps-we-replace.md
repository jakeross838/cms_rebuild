# Apps We Replace

> Our platform replaces 25+ individual tools with one integrated system.

The average custom home builder juggles 8-14 separate software subscriptions, spending $2,000-$5,000/month on tools that don't talk to each other. Data gets re-keyed between systems, errors compound, and the "single source of truth" becomes whichever spreadsheet was updated last. We eliminate all of that.

## Cost Comparison

| Small Builder (5-10 homes/yr) | $2,200 - $3,500 | $499 - $799 | $16,800 - $32,400 |
| Mid-Size Builder (10-25 homes/yr) | $3,500 - $6,000 | $799 - $1,499 | $24,000 - $54,000 |

*Savings exclude productivity gains from eliminated data re-entry, which typically add 15-30 hours/month per project manager.*

## The 5 Connection Chains

> The real power is not in replacing individual tools -- it is in connecting workflows that were never connected before. Data flows through the system in five primary chains, each representing a complete business process that previously required manual hand-offs between 3-8 separate applications.

### Chain 1: Lead to Revenue

```
Marketing Portfolio --> Website Inquiry --> CRM Lead Capture --> Pipeline Management
--> Site Visit Scheduling --> Preliminary Estimate --> Proposal Generation
--> Contract Execution (E-Sign) --> Project Creation --> Revenue Recognized
```

**What this replaces:** A lead comes in through the website (WordPress), gets entered into HubSpot, notes go in a spreadsheet, the estimate is built in Buildxact, the proposal is formatted in Word, the contract goes through DocuSign, and the project is manually created in Buildertrend. Six tools, six manual hand-offs, six chances for data loss.

**What we do:** A website inquiry auto-creates a CRM lead. The estimator pulls from the preliminary conversation to seed a budget. The proposal generates from the estimate with one click. The client e-signs the contract, and the project auto-creates with the budget, schedule template, and client portal already populated. Zero re-keying. Every dollar from lead cost to final revenue is tracked in one unbroken chain.

---

### Chain 2: Plan to Payment

```
Plans & Specs --> Estimating & Takeoffs --> Budget Creation --> Schedule of Values
--> Subcontractor Bidding --> Contracts Issued --> Work Scheduled
--> Work Completed & Verified --> Daily Log & Photos --> Draw Request Generated
--> Lien Waivers Collected --> Invoice Matched --> Payment Released
--> Job Cost Updated --> Profitability Calculated
```

**What this replaces:** Plans live in Dropbox. Takeoffs happen in Buildxact or on paper. The budget is an Excel spreadsheet. The SOV is another spreadsheet. Sub bids come in via email. Sub contracts go through DocuSign. The schedule is in MS Project. Daily logs are in Buildertrend. Draw requests are manual AIA forms in Excel. Lien waivers are tracked in Levelset. Invoices are processed in Bill.com. Payments go through QuickBooks. Job cost reports are compiled manually. Fourteen disconnected steps.

**What we do:** Plans upload to the document hub and feed the estimating engine. The estimate becomes the budget with one click. The budget auto-generates the SOV. Sub bid packages go out with scope pulled from the estimate. Awarded subs get contracts generated from templates. Work gets scheduled and daily logs confirm completion. The draw request auto-populates from completed work. Lien waiver requests go out automatically. Vendor invoices are OCR-captured and matched to budget lines. Payments release when compliance is verified. Job costs update in real time. One continuous flow from blueprint to bank account.

---

### Chain 3: Problem to Resolution

```
Issue Identified (Field/Client/Inspection) --> Issue Logged with Photos & Location
--> Category & Priority Assigned --> Responsible Party Notified
--> Resolution Tracked --> Cost Impact Calculated --> Change Order Generated (if needed)
--> Client Approval Obtained --> Work Completed --> Issue Closed
--> Warranty Record Created (if applicable)
```

**What this replaces:** A problem is spotted on the job site and communicated via text message. Someone emails the sub. The PM creates a punch item in one system and a potential change order in another. The cost is tracked in a spreadsheet. The client is called or emailed for approval. The resolution is noted somewhere -- maybe. The warranty implication is forgotten entirely.

**What we do:** A field issue is logged with photos, GPS pin, and category. The system auto-assigns based on trade and notifies the responsible sub. If there is a cost impact, a change order drafts automatically with the cost data pre-populated. The client approves in their portal. Resolution is tracked with before/after photos. On project close-out, unresolved items automatically generate warranty records with all history attached. The full chain from problem identification to warranty coverage is one unbroken thread.

---

### Chain 4: Change to Cash

```
Change Identified --> Scope Documented --> Cost Estimated (Labor + Material + Markup)
--> Change Order Created --> Client Presented with Options --> Client Approval (E-Sign)
--> Budget Updated --> Schedule Adjusted --> Sub/Vendor Notified
--> Work Executed --> Draw Request Updated --> Payment Collected
--> Margin Impact Reported
```

**What this replaces:** A change is discussed verbally on site. The PM writes it up in Word or an email. The estimator prices it in a spreadsheet. The change order is formatted in another template. The client signs a paper form or replies to an email. Someone manually updates the budget spreadsheet. Someone else adjusts the schedule. The sub finds out eventually. The draw request is manually revised. The financial impact is calculated at the end of the job -- if ever.

**What we do:** A change is initiated from any context -- a daily log entry, a selection change, a client request in the portal, or a field condition. The system pulls relevant cost data from the original estimate and current pricing to auto-generate a priced change order. The client reviews and e-signs in the portal. On approval, the budget adjusts automatically, the schedule updates if there are duration impacts, affected subs are notified, the SOV and draw schedule update, and the margin impact is visible immediately on the project dashboard. From field discovery to cash collection, every step is connected and automatic.

---

### Chain 5: Intelligence Loop

```
All Project Data Collected --> Patterns Analyzed Across Projects
--> Cost Benchmarks Established --> Estimating Accuracy Improved
--> Sub Performance Scored --> Risk Factors Identified
--> Predictive Alerts Generated --> Business Decisions Informed
--> Process Improvements Implemented --> Better Outcomes Measured
```

**What this replaces:** At the end of a project, the builder has a vague sense of whether they made money. Historical data lives in a dozen different systems and nobody has time to compile it. The estimator guesses at costs based on memory. Sub selection is based on relationships, not data. The same mistakes repeat across projects because there is no feedback mechanism.

**What we do:** Every data point from every project feeds into the intelligence engine. Actual costs are compared against estimates to improve future pricing accuracy. Sub performance is scored on quality, schedule adherence, change order frequency, and communication responsiveness. Material cost trends are tracked over time. Project timelines are analyzed for common delay patterns. Cash flow forecasting uses historical patterns, not guesses. The system gets smarter with every project completed -- turning institutional knowledge into organizational intelligence that survives employee turnover and scales with growth.

## The Integration Advantage

The gap between "software that manages construction" and "25 individual tools duct-taped together" is not features -- it is **connections**. Every competitor in our space either:

1. **Does one thing well** (CompanyCam for photos, Buildxact for estimating, Levelset for lien waivers) but forces manual hand-offs to everything else
2. **Does many things poorly** (Buildertrend, CoConstruct) with modules that technically exist but lack depth, forcing builders to keep their specialized tools anyway
3. **Targets the wrong market** (Procore) with enterprise pricing and complexity that custom home builders don't need

We are the first platform built specifically for custom home builders that goes deep enough in each module to actually replace the specialized tool, while connecting every module so data flows without human intervention. The result: builders spend time building houses instead of managing software.
